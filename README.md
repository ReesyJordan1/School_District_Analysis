# School_District_Analysis
Overview
Preparing standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation on performance trends and patterns in reference to student funding.  Afer my first analysis, I was informed that there had been academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. After removing the test scores of Thomas High School, I repeated the analysis and noted changes in the overall analysis. 

#Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
