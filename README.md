# School_District_Analysis
### Overview


##### Preparing standardized reading and math test data for analysis, reporting and presentation on performance trends and patterns in reference to student funding.  Afer my first analysis of the school data, I was informed that there had been academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. After removing the test scores of Thomas High School ninth graders, I repeated the analysis and noted changes in the overall analysis. 



###Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).


Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
